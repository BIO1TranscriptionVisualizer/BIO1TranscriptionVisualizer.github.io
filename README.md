# Transcription Visualizer Project

#### "Explain what you found that piqued your interest and how it relates to Biology."
> I forget the precise chapter but during the lecture going over how DNA transcription works I was struck by how simple an algorithm it was and the thought occured to me that I could probably write some simple code to automate the transcription process and check my work while study.
> 
> Then it dawned on me "Hey" this seems super simple wouldn't there be a phet simulation visualizing and explaining this for students? Well no not really.
>
> So I decided to give a go at it and this was the result, it basically just renders everything in a relatively visually friendly way, there are definitely other projects even on github that can do the task of just simple text conversion but I wanted to get some practice manipulating solid elements from the ground up so here we are.
>
> Unfortunately I didn't have time to add animations or the renderer for proteins, I might do that later in my free time but for now this is what it shall be! It works nicely feel free to give it a shot.
